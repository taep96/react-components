# 📦 React Components

This is a monorepo of useful React packages, each available on NPM and hosted on
GitHub.

## 📦 Components

Currently, there's only one package:

- [react-auto-columns](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-auto-columns). This
  package provides a React component that automatically arranges child elements
  into columns based on the available screen space, similar to the Discord GIF
  browser. It's a great solution for creating product listings, galleries, and
  more. You can find the source code
  [here](https://github.com/taep96/react-components/tree/main/packages/react-auto-columns).

As more packages are developed, they will be added to the list.

## 🚀 Demo

You can see all the packages in action on the [demo website](https://react-components.taep96.moe/).

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions to any of the packages are welcome!

If you have any questions, please reach out to me via Discord or email.
